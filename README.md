### Currently, I'm freelancing as I work on obtaining my degree (B.S. Graphic Information Technology - Full-Stack Web Development). I hope to further my career as a developer and continue to grow my skills. In my free time, I love hanging out with my nephew and niece (5 and 2, respectively), try new food around my neighborhood, and I'm getting back into reading (just finished Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby van Pelt, highly recommend!).

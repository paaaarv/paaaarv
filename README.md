Currently, I'm freelancing as I work on obtaining my degree (B.S. Graphic Information Technology - Full-Stack Web Development). I hope to further my career as a developer and continue to grow my skills. 

In my free time, I love hanging out with my nephew and niece 🛝 , trying new food around my neighborhood 🍲, and getting back into reading 📖 (just finished Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby van Pelt, highly recommend!).
